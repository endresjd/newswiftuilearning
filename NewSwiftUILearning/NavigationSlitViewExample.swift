    var body: some View {
        // You create a navigation split view with two or three columns, and typically
        // use it as the root view in a Scene. People choose one or more items in a
        // leading column to display details about those items in subsequent columns.
        //
        // Unsure how to make this work right on a phone.  It collapses into a stack
        // but the stack doesn't show row indicators (chevrons) or become part of
        // the existing navigation stack.
        //
        // At narrow size classes, such as on iPhone or Apple Watch, a navigation split
        // view collapses into a single stack. Typically SwiftUI automatically chooses
        // the view to show on top of this single stack, based on the content of the
        // split view’s columns

            List(ViewRouter.allCases, id: \.self, selection: $selection) { view in
