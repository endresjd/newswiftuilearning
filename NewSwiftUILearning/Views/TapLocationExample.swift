import SwiftUI

/// Shows a way to get the tap location in a view without needing to bridge to UIKit either
/// relative to the view or relative to other coordinates.
///
/// “Relative location” means relative to the view's bounds – if the view is 100x100 in size, if you tap the exact center it
/// would print 50x50 regardless of where the view was placed on the screen.
///
/// If you want the global location – i.e., where your tap took place relative to the top-left corner of the entire screen – you
/// should add the coordinateSpace parameter like to the `.onTapGesture` modifier.
///
/// - Experiment: Experiment with the `coordinateSpace` parameter to get different results.
/// - Important: iOS 16 minimum
/// - Seealso: [How to detect the location of a tap inside a view](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-detect-the-location-of-a-tap-inside-a-view)
