import SwiftUI

/// Show a simple split view until I understand more.
///
/// You create a navigation split view with two or three columns, and typically
/// use it as the root view in a Scene. People choose one or more items in a
/// leading column to display details about those items in subsequent columns.
///
/// Unsure how to make this work right on a phone.  It collapses into a stack
/// but the stack doesn't show row indicators (chevrons) or become part of
/// the existing navigation stack.
///
/// At narrow size classes, such as on iPhone or Apple Watch, a navigation split
/// view collapses into a single stack. Typically SwiftUI automatically chooses
/// the view to show on top of this single stack, based on the content of the
/// split viewâ€™s columns
///
/// - Important: iOS 16 minimum
