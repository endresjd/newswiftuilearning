/// Show how to animate using this new macro
///
/// - Before iOS 26 this was a little tricky to use, because we needed to create an animatableData value to represent our animatable value
/// - If you're targeting iOS 26 or later, this becomes a lot easier thanks to the @Animatable macro, which automatically makes any properties animatable â€“ you should delete animatableData entirely and let the macro do all the work for you.
///
/// With this, instead of manually animating each property, you animate them all, so you have to manually opt out some of them that you don't want
/// using ` @AnimatableIgnored`
///
/// - SeeAlso: [How to create animatable views, modifiers, and more](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-create-animatable-views-modifiers-and-more)
