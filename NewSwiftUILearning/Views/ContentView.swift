/// Top-level container for the view that shows a list of all views that are defined in the
/// router enum.
///
/// 1. This shows how to use what I call a view router that **does not** require wrapping to `AnyView` but
/// instead uses a `ViewBuilder` to achieve its results.
/// 2. Wraps that list with a searchable field
/// 3. Uses `NavigationStack` for navigation using `.navigationDestination` with the router's enum value.
/// 4. Shows how to run a `Task` before the view first loads.
