import SwiftUI

/// Shows iOS 16's `RenameButton` control
///
/// A rename button receives its action from the environment. Use the `renameAction(_:)`
/// modifier to set the action. The system disables the button if you donâ€™t define an
/// action.
///
/// This example will put the focus on to the `TextField` when the rename button
/// is tapped which brings up the keyboard.
///
/// - Important: This example, with the `contextMenu` is from the help.  It doesn't
///              seem to work on iOS?
/// - Experiment: See how this is really used
/// - Requires: iOS 16
